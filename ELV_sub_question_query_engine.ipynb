The quarter saw growth in commercial fee-based and individual ACA members, offsetting Medicaid attrition. Operating revenue was in line with expectations, with improved benefit expense and disciplined expense management. Operating cash flow was $2 billion, and the debt to capital ratio was maintained within the target range. The strategic partnership with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice was emphasized as a step towards advancing a local-oriented approach to care delivery.\n",

They added nearly 400,000 commercial fee-based members and over 200,000 individual ACA members during the quarter. Operating revenue was $42.3 billion, benefit expense ratio improved by 20 basis points year-over-year, and the adjusted operating expense ratio was consistent with the previous year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and the company maintained a debt to capital ratio of 39.4%. They also repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $566 million during the quarter.\n",
